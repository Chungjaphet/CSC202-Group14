We create a program that allows user to calculate the Area and Volume of the following 2D & 3D shapes.
1. Triangle
2. Circle
3. Rectangle
4. Sphere
5. Cube

To accomplish this project it took the total of 9 Classes
1 for the Shape Class, 5 for the subclass (Triangle, Circle, Rectangle, Sphere & Cube)
2 for the dimensions (2 dimension and 3 dimension shapes) 
while the last is the Main Class.

**In the Shape Class **
We have two methods 
1. The getName method get the name of the shape
2. The calculateArea method calculate the area of the given shape you select

All shapes have a unique class and in each class contain a uniqe code assigned to them

We use the key word extends which signifies inheritance.
INHERITANCE IS USED IN THE FOLLOWING CLASSES
1. TWODIMENSIONALSHAPES TO INHERIT THE PROPERTIES IN THE SHAPE CLASS
2. THREEDIMENSIONALSHAPES TO INHERIT THE PROPERTIES IN THE SHAPE CLASS
AND FOR THE 2D SHAPES
The extends key word is used to inherit the properties in the 2dimentsionalclass
 FOR THE 3D SHAPES
The extends key word is used to inherit the properties in the 3dimentsionalclass
** In the Main Class**
we use the if...else if statement that calculate the Area or Volume of the shape you selected
